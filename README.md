# Carbon Impact Model

## 📌 Objective

This project simulates a carbon impact model to compare scenarios of waste destination and calculate net carbon emissions considering transportation factors.

It is designed to demonstrate structured logic applied in environmental data analysis.

---

## 🌍 Context

In environmental management, the real impact of reuse vs disposal of waste depends on:

- Emissions avoided locally
- Emissions generated by transporting waste
- Modal and distance of transportation

This model demonstrates how to calculate the net impact using structured logic and emission factors.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset (`data.csv`) contains fictional but structured environmental data including:

- Type of waste
- Quantity (tonnes)
- Destination
- Transport mode
- Distance (km)
- Transport emission factors
- Avoided emission factors

This dataset mimics real environmental analysis scenarios.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The model performs the following calculations:

1. **Avoided Emissions**  
   `avoided_emissions = waste_tons × avoided_emission_factor`

2. **Transport Emissions**  
   `transport_emissions = waste_tons × distance_km × emission_factor_transport`

3. **Net Carbon Impact**  
   `net_impact = avoided_emissions − transport_emissions`

Results help compare scenarios and assess environmental performance.

## 🛠 Tools

The project uses:

- Python  
- Pandas

Example script logic is provided in `carbon_model.py`.

## 🧠 Usage

To run the model:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `pip install pandas`)
3. Run:

```bash
python carbon_model.py
