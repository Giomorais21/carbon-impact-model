# Carbon Impact Model

## 📌 Objective
This project simulates an environmental carbon impact model to compare waste destination scenarios and calculate net carbon emissions considering transportation factors.

## 🌍 Context
In environmental management, evaluating the real impact of waste reutilization requires more than analyzing avoided emissions. It is necessary to consider indirect emissions generated by transportation (road, air, maritime).

This model demonstrates how to calculate net carbon impact using structured logic and emission factors.

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Scenario comparison: disposal vs reutilization
- Emission factor by transport mode (road, air, maritime)
- Net carbon impact calculation:
  
  Net Impact = Avoided Emissions - Transport Emissions

## 🛠 Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Data analysis techniques

## 📊 Future Improvements
- Sensitivity analysis
- Scenario simulation automation
- Visualization with Power BI or Matplotlib


## 🔍 Technical Implementation

The model reads a structured dataset (`data.csv`) and performs the following calculations:

1. **Avoided Emissions**  
   waste_tons × avoided_emission_factor

2. **Transport Emissions**  
   waste_tons × distance_km × emission_factor_transport

3. **Net Carbon Impact**  
   avoided_emissions − transport_emissions

The objective is to simulate a structured carbon accounting logic similar to real environmental decision-making scenarios.
